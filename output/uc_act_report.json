  "definitions": "The Act and its related amendments define several key terms. Section 1(3), 1(6) and 1(7) define: (a) the 'consumer prices index' as the all-items CPI published by the Statistics Board; (b) the 'relevant CPI percentage' as the percentage by which CPI for the September before a tax year exceeds the previous September (or 0% if not higher); (c) a 'relevant power' as including powers in section 9(2) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and section 150(2)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992; (d) the 'standard allowance' as the allowance included in an award of universal credit under section 9(1) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012; (e) 'tax year' as the 12 months beginning on 6 April; and (f) 'assessment period' as having the same meaning as in Part 1 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Section 3(2) defines the 'LCWRA element' and 'LCW element' by reference to regulation 27 of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013. Section 5(5) defines the ESA income-related (ESA IR) personal allowance, ESA IR disability premiums, ESA IR support component and ESA IR work-related activity component by reference to the Welfare Reform Act 2007 and the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008. Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 to the Act amend the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 and the Northern Ireland Regulations to define 'pre-2026 claimant', 'severe conditions criteria claimant' and related concepts, as well as terms describing NHS or health and social care services used for diagnostic purposes.",

  "obligations": "The Act imposes mandatory duties—primarily on the Secretary of State in Great Britain and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland—to adjust benefit rates. Section 1(1) requires the Secretary of State to exercise a relevant power so that the standard allowance amounts for tax years 2026–27 to 2029–30 are at least the minimum amounts calculated using CPI and an additional uplift percentage. Section 4(1) requires the Secretary of State to exercise powers in the Welfare Reform Act 2012 to increase either the protected LCWRA amount, the standard allowance, or both, where necessary to ensure that the combined total for each tax year at least equals the previous tax year’s combined total uprated by CPI. Section 5(3) similarly requires the Secretary of State to use powers in the Welfare Reform Act 2007 to increase ESA IR disability premiums, the support component, or the personal allowance to maintain minimum CPI-uprated combinations. In Northern Ireland, Schedule 2 paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 place parallel obligations on the Department for Communities to exercise its powers under the Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 and the Welfare Reform Act (Northern Ireland) 2007. Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 provisions concerning assessments, information requirements and medical examinations create obligations for the administering authorities to carry out assessments and determinations using relevant evidence and appropriate health care diagnoses.",

  "responsibilities": "The primary responsibility lies with the Secretary of State (for Great Britain) to: (a) calculate the minimum standard allowance amounts each year based on CPI and the specified uplift (section 1(2)-(4)); (b) ensure that ordinary annual uprating provisions in section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 do not apply to specified universal credit and ESA IR elements in the relevant years (sections 1(5), 3(1), 5(2)); (c) maintain the real-terms value of protected LCWRA amounts and ESA IR payments by exercising the relevant powers where CPI-based conditions require it (sections 4 and 5). The Department for Communities in Northern Ireland bears parallel responsibilities under Schedule 2 to apply the same approach within the Northern Ireland social security system. Through amendments in Schedule 1 and Schedule 2, decision-makers in the Department for Work and Pensions (or Northern Ireland equivalent) are responsible for determining whether a claimant is a pre-2026 claimant, a severe conditions criteria claimant, or has limited capability for work and work-related activity, based on assessments and medical evidence, and for applying the correct LCWRA amount. Health care professionals within NHS or corresponding services have responsibility for providing diagnoses that underpin severe conditions criteria determinations.",

  "eligibility": "Eligibility rules in the Act operate mainly through distinctions between categories of claimants and the time at which entitlement arose. For the LCWRA element, Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 amendments create: (a) 'pre-2026 claimants' who were entitled to an award of universal credit including the LCWRA element at any time before 6 April 2026 and who have remained continuously entitled (with short gaps allowed when financial conditions are not met); (b) 'severe conditions criteria claimants' who both have limited capability for work and work-related activity and meet strict criteria that at least one Schedule 7 descriptor constantly applies for the rest of the claimant’s life, due to a specific bodily or mental condition diagnosed by an appropriately qualified health care professional; and (c) claimants who are terminally ill. These groups remain eligible for the higher, protected LCWRA amount. Other claimants with limited capability for work and work-related activity from 6 April 2026 onwards receive the new standard LCWRA amount (e.g. £217.26 as referenced in the amended regulations). Eligibility for standard allowance increases covers all universal credit claimants whose awards include standard allowance in the relevant tax years. For ESA IR, eligibility for the protected combinations of personal allowance, disability premiums, support component and work-related activity component is determined by whether a person is entitled to those components under existing ESA rules, with the Act governing how their amounts are uprated over time.",

  "payments": "The Act provides explicit payment calculation and entitlement structures. Section 1 sets out a stepwise formula for determining the minimum amounts of the universal credit standard allowance for each tax year 2026–27 to 2029–30: starting from the previous year’s amounts (or 2025–26 for the first year), increasing by the relevant CPI percentage, then further increasing by a fixed uplift percentage (2.3%, 3.1%, 4.0% and 4.8% respectively). Section 1 also defines how these amounts apply to assessment periods in a given tax year. Section 2, along with Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 amendments, introduces a new LCWRA amount for most claimants and preserves a higher protected LCWRA amount for pre-2026, severe conditions criteria and terminally ill claimants. Section 3 freezes the base LCWRA and LCW elements in that ordinary uprating provisions do not apply for the specified tax years, but section 4 ensures that the combined total of the protected LCWRA amount and standard allowance must increase at least in line with CPI each year. Section 5 applies analogous CPI-based uprating rules to ESA IR personal allowances, disability premiums, and support/work-related activity components, ensuring that combinations of these amounts maintain at least their previous-year real value. Schedule 2 replicates these structures for Northern Ireland, tying application of amounts to assessment periods or benefit weeks as defined in the relevant legislation.",

  "penalties": "The Act does not create new criminal offences, civil penalties, or explicit enforcement sanctions against claimants or the administering authorities. Instead, its primary function is to adjust benefit calculation rules and suspends or modifies ordinary uprating provisions for certain periods. The only 'enforcement-like' effect is indirect: if a claimant does not meet the conditions for LCWRA, severe conditions criteria, or ESA IR components, they may receive lower or no payments of those elements. Sections 1(5), 3(1) and 5(2) disapply the normal annual uprating rules in section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 for certain elements in the specified tax years; this is a structural change to benefit uprating, not a penalty regime. Information and medical examination requirements in the amended regulations (for example, the power to find that someone does not have limited capability for work and work-related activity if they do not comply) can have the effect of reducing entitlement, but function as eligibility and compliance mechanisms rather than explicit penalties contained within the primary Act itself.",

  "record_keeping": "Through amendments in Schedule 1 and Schedule 2, the Act relies on 'relevant evidence' for reassessments and determinations and requires claimants to provide information and attend medical examinations. It also depends on accurate records of entitlement history to identify pre-2026 claimants and track assessment periods or benefit weeks. However, the Act does not introduce a dedicated, detailed record-keeping framework; instead it relies on existing social security systems to maintain claimant records and medical documentation."
