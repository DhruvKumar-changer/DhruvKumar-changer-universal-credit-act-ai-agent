# Universal Credit Act 2025 – Summary (5–10 Key Points)

- **Purpose**  
  The Act updates the rates and uprating rules for the universal credit standard allowance, LCW (limited capability for work), LCWRA (limited capability for work and work-related activity), and certain ESA (Employment and Support Allowance) components for tax years 2026–27 to 2029–30.

- **Standard Allowance Structure**  
  Each year’s standard allowance must follow a CPI-based increase, plus an additional uplift percentage (2.3%, 3.1%, 4.0%, 4.8%) for the respective tax years, overriding the usual annual up-rating rules.

- **Key Definitions**  
  The Act defines “consumer prices index”, “relevant CPI percentage”, “standard allowance”, “assessment period”, and—through amendments—“pre-2026 claimant” and “severe conditions criteria claimant”.

- **Two-Tier LCWRA Amount System**  
  From 6 April 2026, new claimants get a lower LCWRA amount (£217.26), while protected groups (pre-2026 claimants, severe conditions criteria claimants, terminally ill claimants) retain a higher LCWRA amount.

- **Freeze on LCW & LCWRA Elements**  
  For tax years ending 2026–2029, normal benefit uprating rules don’t apply to these components.

- **Protection for Existing Claimants**  
  Pre-2026 LCWRA claimants keep a higher benefit level as long as their entitlement continues (with allowed short gaps).

- **Assessment Criteria**  
  To qualify as a “severe conditions criteria claimant”, a claimant must have a lifelong condition meeting a Schedule 7 descriptor, diagnosed by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional.

- **Legacy ESA Changes**  
  Similar CPI-based adjustments apply to ESA income-related payments, disability premiums, and support/work-related activity components.

- **Northern Ireland Correspondence**  
  Schedule 2 applies the same structure through Northern Ireland’s social security legislation.

- **Short Title**  
  The Act is officially cited as the Universal Credit Act 2025.
